## Let's get started!

Thank you for choosing EarthWatch! Before you can start enjoying beautiful
views of Earth, there's a few setup steps we have to run through.

We recommend opening these instructions on another device, so you can follow along.

First, push the power button once to turn off and then again to turn back on.

When you see the lock screen, tap and hold until you see the Customize and + buttons appear at the bottom.

At the top, choose **Photo Shuffle**.

Click the **Album** option twice to select an Album.

From the list, choose **EarthWatch** (it may be at the very bottom).

For Shuffle Frequency, choose **On Lock**.

You should now see one of our satellite images on the screen.

Next, choose **Add** in the top right.

When asked if you would like to set as a wallpaper pair, choose **Customize Home Screen**.

Click the **Blur** droplet in the bottom right corner, and then **Done** in the top right.

Lastly, click the lock screen layout show in the screen, and you're all set!

As new images of Earth are made available, EarthWatch will automatically download them and update your iPhone screen background in, well, the background!
